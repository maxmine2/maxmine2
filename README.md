# Hi! I'm maxmine2

aka Max Budko, aka mxbdk, aka Pickaxe

## 👀 I’m interested in Programming

- 🌱 I’m currently learning JS and Python. I also want to learn Assembler and C (C++)

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on diffrent projects, but I prefer my own projects.


It's been a while since I went there for the last time.
Having some interesting ideas in my mind, hope I'll get them done =)

## My currentd "Cool-idea" list
*This list has all my cool ideas I will never do*
- Inkwell (*in development*)
- +1 (*OS*)
- Findpet (*project to help people find their pets, reporting their find and showing "Lost somewhere around you" pets*)

**More ideas soon*
